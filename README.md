This is a working online store app. Very simplistic backend mechanics.

This app contained a pre-defined amount of products the user can select from. 

Using inquirer prompts you can select which product you would like to purchase.

Once a product is selected you can then input the quantity you would like of that item.

If your quantity request doesn't exceed the stock quantity of that item it will lead you to a confirm purchase prompt; displaying the total price.

Once confirmed it will remove the selected quantity from the selected product items stock. 

So once the shop is ran again it will display the new product stock of the previously purchased item.
